/**
 * Runs an effect exactly once on mount and its cleanup exactly once on
 * unmount. Ported from Prototemplate/src/lib/use-mount-effect.ts
 * (PORTED_FROM.json).
 *
 * React's StrictMode simulates an unmount right after mount: it calls the
 * cleanup and then the effect again, synchronously. A plain "ran once" guard
 * would skip that second call and leave the effect torn down, so every
 * listener registered here would be dead in dev. The cleanup is therefore
 * deferred by one task: the simulated re-run lands first and cancels it, so
 * the original setup stays live; a real unmount has no re-run, and the
 * deferred cleanup fires. The effect body itself still runs at most once per
 * mounted instance, so setup code that appends DOM nodes without undoing
 * them stays safe.
